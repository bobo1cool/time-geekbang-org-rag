You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.              When do Labor Day sales end?       Labor Day 2024 falls on Monday, Sept. 2, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Most sales are live or will start to go live soon. Though some might last up to that day, a few might extend past that. We'll be monitoring sales so you can nab the most savings this year.              Should I wait for Black Friday sales?       Labor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those types of products.        Black Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \"Prime Early Access Sale\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.               How do I make the most of Labor Day sales?        Before diving into Labor Day sales, the best thing to do is to narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the many different Labor Day sales out there. Here's a quick list to make it easier for you.        Best Labor Day Amazon deals Best Labor Day laptop dealsBest Labor Day Target dealsBest Labor Day TV dealsBest Labor Day Best Buy dealsBest Labor Day tablet dealsThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on all of the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to follow the team on Twitter and sign up for the CNET Deals newsletter.       \n    Impulse Buys Under $25 That Actually Make Great Gifts\n            \n        +18 More\n       See all photos  ",

Need gift ideas for birthdays, anniversaries and other events? Our\\u00a0gift guide\\u00a0includes a huge range of suggestions for every occasion.              Which Labor Day sales are the best?       There are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you to shop will depend on what you're hoping to buy.\\u00a0       Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind with stores like Lowe's, Home Depot and Overstock being the places to begin your hunt for home and garden products.\\u00a0       Don't rule out more niche retailers like B&H Photo, Dell, HP and GameStop, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.              When do Labor Day sales end?       Labor Day 2024 falls on Monday, Sept. 2, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Most sales are live or will start to go live soon. Though some might last up to that day, a few might extend past that. We'll be monitoring sales so you can nab the most savings this year.              Should I wait for Black Friday sales?       Labor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those types of products.\\u00a0       Black Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \\\"Prime Early Access Sale\\\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.\\u00a0              How do I make the most of Labor Day sales?\\u00a0       Before diving into Labor Day sales, the best thing to do is to narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the many different Labor Day sales out there. Here's a quick list to make it easier for you.\\u00a0       Best Labor Day Amazon deals\\u00a0Best Labor Day laptop dealsBest Labor Day Target dealsBest Labor Day TV dealsBest Labor Day Best Buy dealsBest Labor Day tablet dealsThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on all of the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to\\u00a0follow the team on Twitter\\u00a0and sign up for the\\u00a0CNET Deals newsletter.       \\n  \"}]}\n摘要：本文介绍了25美元以下的冲动购买礼物，这些礼物实际上非常适合作为礼物赠送。\n本文讨论了当前网络时代下，社交媒体对人们生活的影响。社交媒体已经成为现代人生活中不可或缺的一部分，它不仅改变了人们的社交方式，还对人们的心理、行为和价值观产生了深远的影响。\n\n  首先，社交媒体为人们提供了更加便捷的社交方式，使得人们可以随时随地与他人进行互动和交流。通过社交媒体，人们可以与世界各地的朋友和亲人保持联系，同时还可以认识新朋友、建立新的社交网络。此外，社交媒体也提供了更加个性化的服务，满足人们的不同需求。\n\n  其次，社交媒体在人们的心理和行为方面也产生了影响。由于社交媒体的普及，人们越来越依赖它来获取信息和娱乐。然而，过度使用社交媒体可能会导致一些心理问题，如焦虑、抑郁等。此外，社交媒体上的信息泛滥和虚假信息传播也可能会对人们的判断和决策产生影响。\n\n  最后，社交媒体对人们的价值观也产生了影响。在社交媒体上，人们更容易接触到不同的文化和思想，从而促进了多元文化的交流和融合。然而，社交媒体也可能导致人们过于关注他人的生活和评价，从而对自己的生活产生不切实际的期望和压力。\n\n  总的来说，社交媒体已经深深地影响了人们的日常生活。在享受其便利和快乐的同时，我们也需要意识到它可能带来的负面影响。因此，我们需要保持适当的社交媒体使用习惯，避免过度依赖和沉迷于其中。\n\n摘要：\n\n本文探讨了社交媒体在现代生活中的影响，包括其改变社交方式、影响心理行为及价值观。社交媒体便利了人们与他人交流和联系，但也引发了心理问题如焦虑、抑郁等。同时，信息泛滥和虚假信息传播也可能影响人们的判断和决策。此外，社交媒体促进了多元文化交流，但也可能导致人们对他人生活和评价过度关注，产生不切实际的期望和压力。因此，我们需要保持适当的社交媒体使用习惯以避免负面影响。\n摘要：上述文本中只给出了“+18 More”这一信息，没有提供足够的上下文来形成有效的摘要。请提供更多信息或文本，以便我能够为其提供摘要。\n摘要：查看所有照片。\n"

Strands just moved out of beta, so it's now in the New York Times' official Games app, which might bring it more fans. I go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story. If you're looking for today's Connections and Wordle answers, you can visit CNET's NYT puzzle hints page.Read more: NYT Connections Turns 1: These Are the 5 Toughest Puzzles So FarHow to play NYT Strands1. Use today's theme to look for words relating to that topic. See one? Drag or click the letters in order. Click on the last letter twice to submit your guess. If you've found a theme word, it'll light up in blue and stay that way.2. Other words you find are considered hint words that give you clues to the theme words. Find three hint words (they must have at least four letters each), and the game will reward you by showing you a theme word. But if you can't unscramble it, find three more hint words and the game will highlight the theme word's letters in order.3. Hunt for the spangram, a special theme word that spans the entire puzzle, though it could flow across or top to bottom. It summarizes the puzzle theme.4. When you're done, you'll have used every letter on the board in either a theme word or spangram. Theme words fill the entire board and do not overlap. Hint for today's Strands puzzleToday's Strands theme is: Serve ginger-ly?If that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Golden State snack.Clue words to unlock in-game hintsYour goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words.

The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you've got all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. Here are the nonspangram answers:CRAB, MAYO, RICE, AVOCADO, SEAWEED, CUCUMBER.Today's Strands spangramToday's Strands spangram is CALIFORNIA ROLL. To find it, start with the C that's two letters in from the left on the bottom row, and wind up and over.      NYT Strands completed puzzle for Sept. 1, 2024.
