We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold at Home Depot to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.\n    Impulse Buys Under $25 That Actually Make Great Gifts\n            \n        +18 More\n       See all photos  ",
