        "新闻内容": "The heatwaves have been rolling high as the weather becomes more and more interesting. Some people are even experiencing regular blackouts. With these situations coming up, energy bills have been rising alongside the heat. One report anticipates the average cost to cool a home this summer will be $719 -- the highest in 10 years.If you want to avoid paying those energy bills this summer while making sure you're able to stay cool, you'll want to invest in energy-efficient window fabrics. Different window treatments are one of the easiest ways that you could invest in the overall energy efficiency of your household.An energy-efficient home keeps you comfortable, uses fewer resources and saves you money. There are plenty of ways to boost your home's efficiency, from simple changes like turning the lights off when you leave a room to bigger projects like installing solar panels. But you may be missing out on one of the most effective and easiest ways to save on energy. Window treatments like curtains, blinds, shades and awnings have the power to seriously boost energy efficiency. The right window treatments, also called window attachments, can keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. They can also cut your utility spending throughout the year.\"For a typical home, the window area is less than 10% of the overall shell. But the Department of Energy has estimated that windows can account for up to 50% of the energy that flows in and out of the home,\" said Tom Culp, owner of Birch Point Consulting in Wisconsin and a board member of nonprofit public interest group the Attachments Energy Rating Council. \"Windows have an oversized importance in your home's energy performance and your energy bills.\"How do curtains and blinds save energy?Window treatments can make your home more energy efficient in a couple of different ways. How they can help and the right window treatments to purchase for energy savings depend on the time of year and the climate where you live. When it's cold and dark in the winter, the right window treatments can act as a barrier, preventing your home from losing heat through leaks or cracks around your windows. They can also keep cold, drafty air from entering your home. \"You have a lot of energy going in and out of your home through the windows,\" said Culp. \"A blind or shade will provide an insulating layer to help block some of that heat loss, especially at night.\"In warm, sunny weather, blinds, shades, films and other treatments block the sun, keeping your home cooler during the hottest times of the day. In colder climates, sunlight can be beneficial in winter and the shoulder seasons.      Some window treatments are better at blocking sunlight than others. Tunatura/Getty Images\"The sun coming in your window can be good or bad. Where I live in Wisconsin, it helps to warm your house and offset heating costs,\" said Culp. \"If you're in the South, maybe the sun isn't your friend in the summer. A blind or shade can block some of that sunlight and stop that extra heat from coming in and adding to your air conditioning costs. It really depends on where you are in the country and your specific application.\"Not all window treatments are created equal. To get the most value and find the right product for you, it's important to understand the different window treatments available. Insulated cellular shadesAlso called honeycomb shades or cellular shades, these pleated fabric shades are considered the most high-performing window treatment option in terms of R-value, which measures the performance of a building's insulation. Their honeycomb shape creates a layer of air that blocks heat or cold from entering your home. They also have the most potential to help you save on energy. Insulated cellular shades reduced energy use by 20% in one study conducted by the US Department of Energy. Find cellular shades for your home  See at The Home Depot Thermal curtainsThermal curtains resemble everyday fabric curtains, but they differ from decorative curtains in a significant way. They're made from multiple layers of thick, insulating fabric designed to hold in cool or warm air and prevent leakage or drafts from windows.Find thermal curtains for your home  See at The Home Depot Thermal blindsThermal blinds are year-round window treatments that create a heat-reflecting barrier on your home's windows. Similar to insulated cellular shades, these blinds often have honeycomb-shaped pockets to trap a layer of air that acts as a thermal barrier between the window and your home. An aluminum layer on each side of the blinds reflects heat out in the summer and into your space in the winter.Find thermal blinds for your home  See at Amazon Window quiltsA window quilt works the same way as a quilt made for your bed. By sewing layers of fabric together with an insulating layer between them, a window quilt blocks air from getting in or out through your windows. They also completely block the sun, making them do double-duty as blackout curtains, and can help reduce outside noise.Window quilts are available in roll-up and pull-up models to allow for more flexibility, though some are designed with velcro or snaps to attach the treatment around all four sides of the window. Find window quilts for your home  See at Amazon Window filmsUnlike the other window treatments on this list, which are attached to the interior or exterior of your windows to help with energy efficiency, films are applied directly to the glass. Window films reduce warming from the sun's heat as well as glare and UV rays, but because they're not adjustable, they're better for warm, sunny climates rather than cold ones. Because window films are tinted, they provide privacy while allowing you to see outside, unlike curtains and blinds. Find window films for your home  See at The Home Depot AwningsWhen attached to your home's exterior above windows, awnings block sunlight, preventing solar heat gain in your home. Fixed and adjustable models are available, and you can install a single awning over a window or a longer awning that can shade the windows over one entire side of your house.Like window films, awnings may be a better option for homeowners in warm climates, as blocking the sun will require more energy to heat your home in winter.Find window awnings for your home  See at The Home Depot How do you find energy-efficient curtains and blinds?On AERC's residential product search page, you can find certified window treatments and even filter and sort to find products that fit your needs and climate. While you probably have an idea of whether your home is more in need of cooling or heating for more of the year, the organization also has a climate zone map that can help you choose whether the AERC's cool or warm rating is more relevant to your home.       Lowering blinds on a sunny day can keep your house cooler. Imgorthand/Getty ImagesYou can also look for products with the AERC's Energy Improvement Label when you're shopping in person. Each rating label includes a number for how well the product performs in cool climates as well as warm climates.Regardless of the window attachments you choose, you'll get the most energy savings when they're adjusted regularly according to conditions outside. Another Department of Energy study found that 75% of window coverings stay in the same position every day, and more than half of US households don't adjust their window coverings daily. Culp sees that fact as an opportunity for automation to make energy-efficient window treatments even more effective. \"What automation can do better than most homeowners is open your window treatments when it's advantageous for you and closed when it's not,\" he said. \"You can control it yourself from an app or it can be set to be run optimally. It knows when it will save you the most energy and the most money so that you get better performance.\"Will regular curtains and blinds improve efficiency?\"All window attachments will have an impact, from basic mini-slat blinds to decorative sheers to high-performance insulating cellular shades,\" Culp said. The curtains or blinds you can pick up at a department store or big-box store haven't been designed specifically for energy efficiency. They may reduce your energy use somewhat, but you'll likely see a bigger impact on your utility bills with a product that's labeled as energy efficient and an AERC rating that makes sense for your home and your climate. Frequently asked questions     Will curtains and blinds lower my energy bill?        Yes. Even regular blinds and shades will offer some energy savings when they're deployed properly. You'll see greater savings and use less energy with window treatments that are specifically designed for energy efficiency and have an AERC rating that makes sense for your home and climate.              How do I know the window treatments I'm buying are energy efficient?        Look for AERC ratings on product packaging, or use the AERC's website to find products with energy efficiency ratings.        "

        "新闻内容": "In a major win for internet providers like Starlink, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration on Monday released much-anticipated guidance for how states can use Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment funding on alternative technologies like low-Earth orbit satellites. While this news is far from set in stone, it could have major implications down the road for rural residents without any access to high-speed internet.The $42.5 billion BEAD program is the federal government’s largest-ever investment in broadband, allowing each US state and territory to apply for funding to expand the infrastructure needed for high-speed internet. Any projects financed by BEAD must support the FCC's 100Mbps download/20Mbps upload speed requirement, which was increased from a minimum of 25/3Mbps standard in March.From the start, the NTIA has made it clear that expanding fiber infrastructure is the priority for states applying for BEAD money. While that’s still the case, states can now turn to “alternative technologies” in areas where no cable or fiber internet providers are operating.  Locating local internet providers  “My gut reaction is that this is a pretty big gift to Starlink,” Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State University, told CNET. “But, of course, we have to remember that these are really only for the extreme high cost areas.”When states receive bids from internet providers to expand infrastructure, they’ll still have to prioritize technologies like fiber, cable, licensed fixed wireless and DSL first.  Locating local internet providers  “Fiber is a future-proof technology that will grow with families’ data needs over time. It is the gold standard,” BEAD program director Evan Feinman wrote in a blog post announcing the guidance. “But where fiber is not economically feasible, states and territories have other options.”If fiber (and cable, DSL or licensed fixed wireless) providers don’t exist in an area -- or if they’re too costly to deploy -- states can consider unlicensed fixed wireless and low-Earth orbit satellite providers. This doesn’t include satellite providers like Hughesnet and Viasat, which use satellites farther from the Earth’s surface and don’t meet BEAD’s speed requirements. Good news for Starlink, but it may have a speed problemThe NTIA’s announcement is great news for the one low-Earth orbit satellite provider currently operating in the US (Amazon’s Project Kuiper will reportedly begin offering service next year). Starlink is owned by SpaceX, which is owned by Elon Musk, who said on X in June that BEAD “is an outrageous waste of taxpayer money and is utterly failing to serve people in need.” At the time, the NTIA didn’t consider Starlink eligible for BEAD money, but there have been signs that that was changing. SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said at a conference on Aug. 6 that SpaceX is working with the NTIA to determine whether Starlink could bid on BEAD projects and that it was “very interested in participating.” I think this might be another example of the politics of \"good enough,\" where we're getting the minimum threshold of legality under BEAD without a lot of forethought into how these networks can scale. \n    Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State University\n  The NTIA’s guidance says two requirements will need to be met to accept a Starlink bid: No government program is already funding alternative technologies in the area and no provider is already offering service that meets BEAD’s speed and latency requirements. In other words, this applies only to exceptionally rural and hard-to-reach areas. If both of those are true, Starlink can begin showing documentation that it can connect every home in a given area up to BEAD’s standards.But there’s no guarantee that Starlink can meet BEAD’s speed requirements of 100Mbps download speed, 20Mbps upload speed and latency of less than or equal to 100 milliseconds. The most recent Ookla speed test data shows Starlink users in the US got average speeds of 79Mbps download, 10Mbps upload and 58ms latency -- below the requirements in every category. The NTIA didn't immediately respond to CNET’s request for comment on whether Starlink would be eligible with its current speeds. Ali said he worries about the costs of providing the service in the future.“My concern from the get-go after reading this guidance memo is, ‘Okay, what happens next?’ We are prepared for these extremely high cost areas to offer them broadband that will be very difficult to scale,” Ali said. “Yes, it has to abide by the minimum criteria, but what happens 10 years down the line, when more and more folks are getting fiber and extreme high cost areas still remain extreme high cost areas.”BEAD funding will pay for Starlink’s pricey equipmentAnother core component of the BEAD program is affordability. The NTIA requires that internet providers applying for funds must ensure that “high-quality broadband services are available to all middle-class families … at reasonable prices.” While this requirement is ambiguous, a Pew study found that it could range from $107.64 in the Northeast to $84.79 in the South.Starlink’s residential internet plan costs $120 per month, but the more onerous cost for many potential users is its $499 fee for equipment (on sale for $299 until Oct. 5). The NTIA noted in its guidance that these equipment costs “can be substantially more expensive” than with other providers and that these costs could be subsidized under BEAD to ensure that “installation and equipment costs are not a barrier to adoption” for people living in those areas. “Something I was actually surprised by is that equipment cost has to be built in,” Ali said. “I was really glad to see this because I know that in my research, one of the major barriers for folks with Starlink is that initial cost.” Starlink didn't respond to CNET’s request for comment, but we’ll update this story as it develops. "

        "新闻内容": "Illinois is a deregulated energy state, meaning you can choose where you purchase your energy. Finding the right electric plan for your home can get tricky.  In most deregulated energy states, you can save money on your energy bills by choosing an electric plan from an energy company instead of the local utility. Electricity in Illinois works a bit differently. You can still shop around for a better rate, but your overall savings will depend on how the retail energy supplier's (or energy company's) rates compete with the utility's rates.\"Since 2015, Illinois consumers on alternative electricity suppliers have lost $1.8 billion because they're on plans with higher rates than the utility,\" Jim Chilsen, communication director of the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) in Illinois, told CNET.    \n      We'll help you find the best electricity rates in your area\n        \n          Advertiser disclosure\n           \n            Advertiser disclosure\n             This advertisement widget will direct you to www.chooseenergy.com.

Despite having the freedom to select an alternative provider, you could end up paying more than your local utility's rate. This issue, combined with the challenge of climate change and rising energy prices, makes it difficult for many Illinoisans to afford their energy bills. Fortunately, there are ways to cut back on your energy usage that can make a big difference. \"Knowledge is power. Many consumers don't know that energy efficiency programs and tips can lower their bills,\" Chilsen said.   \n      We'll help you find the best electricity rates in your area\n        \n          Advertiser disclosure\n           \n            Advertiser disclosure\n             This advertisement widget will direct you to www.chooseenergy.com.

Since Illinois operates on a deregulated energy market, you can stick with the local utility's electric plan or choose an alternative retail electric supplier. If you decide to pick an ARES plan, you still receive transmission and distribution services from your local utility, but you're buying your electricity from the ARES. Ameren and ComEd are the major electric utility companies in Illinois. Electric rates can fluctuate based on the energy market. You can find the latest utility rates on Ameren or ComEd's websites. The Citizens Utility Board of Illinois also updates a page featuring a quick breakdown of current electric rates for each utility in Illinois. You can compare these rates to your electric bill to determine if you should stay with your current electricity provider or look for a better deal. However, there's a common misunderstanding. \"Some customers do not realize they're with an ARES and think they are getting it from the utility,\" Chilsen said. To determine who your energy provider is you can \"Look at the supply section of your bill. If it's not ComEd or Ameren, check the rate and compare it to the utility rate.\" The table below shows the average electric rates in Illinois in 2022, according to data from the Energy Information Administration:Average electric bill in Illinois  Average electricity price (in cents per kilowatt-hour)Average monthly usage (kWh)Average electric bill Illinois 15.65720$112.74United States 15.04899$135.25    Shopping for electricity in IllinoisIf you're unhappy with the cost of your energy bill, you can search for a better electricity rate in Illinois. \"We urge extreme caution to anybody shopping on the market to be careful and don't get lured into a bad deal. There will be times when your utility supply rate goes up because of market conditions, but your alternative supplier is impacted by the same market,\" Chilsen said. If you find an energy company and plan you prefer, you can switch providers online or over the phone using proof of residence and your utility account number.Always read the fine print before signing a contract. Some energy plans may seem appealing at first but can include hidden terms. If you sign up for an ARES, keep a watch on your bill. Chilsen said, \"If it stops saving you money, you should be able to get out of it without penalty.\" You might also get door-to-door or over-the-phone salespeople asking for your bill information or account number. \"Do not give it to them. An unethical sales rep could sign you up for an offer without your permission.\" To avoid getting scammed, check online energy provider reviews and search for the company on the Illinois Commerce Commission utility database. Getting solar panels in IllinoisInstalling a solar panel system can help cut your energy bills quite a bit. You'll also be generating your electricity and lessening your reliance on the power grid. If your solar system generates more electricity than your home needs, you can sell your excess energy to the grid through a process called net metering. This can help you save even more money and lower your solar payback period. \"If you're interested in solar, now might be a good time to move forward. Illinois is going through a solar boom and there are several great incentives to cover most of the cost,\" Chilsen said.When shopping for solar, it's important to get quotes from multiple installers in your area, compare quotes and review customer testimonials to find the best installer for you. Eligible households can receive financial aid toward the cost of a solar panel system through programs like Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All. If you can't install panels on your roof, community solar programs are a great alternative, allowing you to power your home with solar energy without needing to install your own system. Electric bill assistance in IllinoisIllinois offers several resources to help you manage and lower your utility bills. \"The state of Illinois has the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act to help people afford their bills and avoid getting disconnected,\" Latifat Moradeyo, energy policy analyst at the Illinois Commerce Commission, told CNET. \"Affordability is subjective. What's affordable to me, may not be affordable to you. No matter what companies charge, someone can not afford it, so they set up incentives.\"Thanks to CEJA, Ameren and ComEd offer programs and benefits for customers to help afford electricity. Here's a list of energy assistance programs in Illinois from utilities and the federal government:Illinois Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program: Eligible households receive a one-time benefit to help pay for winter energy bills. Check your eligibility and learn how to apply by contacting a local representative. Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program: Helps low-income households save energy by improving home energy efficiency. Contact your local Community Action Agency to apply. ComEd Payment Assistance: ComEd customers can choose assistance programs based on needs, whether it's budget billing, payment arrangements, due date extensions or waiving a deposit. Find assistance programs for ComEd customers online. Ameren Payment Assistance: Ameren customers can request payment extensions, budget billing and other programs. Find Ameren assistance resources online. Military discounts: Veterans and active-duty military can receive discounts on electricity in Illinois from their utility company. For example, Ameren offers up to $600 in bill payment assistance.When searching for energy assistance, Chilsen recommends, \"Your first call should be to your utility to see if they have any energy assistance or efficiency programs to help lower your bills.\" By keeping the line of communication open with your utility, you can save money and prevent your power from being shut off. Energy-saving tips for IllinoisansLowering your energy consumption is the best way to save on energy costs. This can be accomplished with lifestyle changes or larger energy efficiency projects. The less energy you use, the lower your bill will be. \"Like climate change, the energy burden is big, but don't let that stop you from taking action to lower your bills,\" Chilsen said. \"Small steps forward are better than inaction.\" For example, if buying a new energy-efficient refrigerator is not in your budget, take steps to make your current fridge more efficient. You can clean the coils on the back and make sure the door seals properly. You can always consider buying a more energy-efficient model in the future. Here are a few additional ways to increase the energy efficiency of your home.Get a free home energy assessment Home energy assessments review the energy efficiency of your home and provide ways to improve and home repair recommendations. ComEd and Ameren customers can receive a free home energy audit from the utility. Or, you can always take the do-it-yourself approach. Ask your utility about free or discounted energy-saving products. You might be able to get LED light bulbs, programmable thermostats and other energy-saving tools.Maintain your HVAC systemHeating and cooling costs are one of the most expensive parts of your energy bill. Regularly changing your system's air filters and getting an annual performance check ensures your system operates efficiently and doesn't drive up electricity prices. Participate in peak-time savingsThe demand for electricity during specific times of day can get pretty intense, especially during the summer and winter months. To lessen the demand, some utilities offer a free program for customers to earn bill credits in exchange for reducing their energy usage during peak hours. Participants receive a notification to reduce their usage during specific hours of the day. If you successfully consume fewer kilowatt-hours of electricity than you did the previous year, you can earn bill credits or gift cards. The terms and credit amount vary by utility. You can enroll in ComEd or Ameren peak time savings programs online."

        "新闻内容": "Another trifold phone from a Chinese company is in our midst following the spotting of one from Huawei. But this time it's the Phantom Ultimate 2, a concept phone from Tecno that was unveiled Tuesday at the IFA technology conference in Berlin. Tecno says that its concept foldable phone \"reimagines the large-screen experience in a pocket-sized device.\" Unlike book-style folding phones such as Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Phantom Ultimate 2's cover screen unfurls into a larger \"screen\" measuring 10 inches, which is significantly larger than the 7.6- and 8-inch displays found on its book style-counterparts.However, the Ultimate 2 doesn't compromise portability according to Tecno. The trifold phone concept is 11.1 millimeters thick -- that's just a few millimeters thicker than current book-style phones. The Phantom Ultimate 2's thinness is helped partially by its a slim battery that measures just 0.25 millimeters. No details were shared on the device's weight, though Tecno says its concept foldable was designed with hinges that have been tested for 300,000 folds, which is 200,000 folds fewer than leading book-style phones like the Honor Magic V3.      Here are two different colors of the Tecno Phantom V Flip 5G. TecnoTecno is no stranger to foldable phones, having launched its first flip phone, the Phantom V Flip 5G, and book-style phone, the Phantom V Fold, globally last year, with next-gen models expected to launch in September. Tecno -- along with rivals including Huawei, OnePlus and Google -- are keen to grab a bigger share of the foldable phones market that is typically dominated by Samsung, which launched its sixth generation series of foldable phones in August. While the sub-category currently makes up a fraction of the broader foldable phones market, that piece of the pie is growing. The worldwide foldable market is forecast to reach 25 million devices by the end of 2024, up 37.6% from the 18.1 million units shipped in 2023, according to research firm the International Data Corporation. By 2028, total foldable phone shipments worldwide are expected to rise to 45.7 million units, IDC predicts, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 20.3% for 2023-2028.A video released by Tecno illustrates various use cases of the Phantom Ultimate 2. One frame showed an individual multitasking with three different vertically oriented windows, making use of each of the screens. Another portion showed off the various ways the Ultimate 2 could fold including a mode where it mimicked the experience of a laptop: using the base screen flat for typing like a keyboard, leaving the remaining two displays stacked like a laptop screen.In addition, Tecno says when folded into \"tent mode\" (pictured below), it allows for face-to-face interactions in different languages, with AI processing the real-time language translation. The company says the Phantom Ultimate 2 runs on software that offers a \"user experience specifically optimized for the trifold design.\"       The Phantom Ultimate 2 folded in a position that Tecno calls tent mode. TecnoTriple-folding concept phones, for their part, are not new. Samsung gave us a glimpse at trifold display concepts back in 2022 at CES. Prior to that, TCL showed a concept off in 2020. But none of them have been released or mass produced for commercial sales. Earlier this month however, Huawei's rumored trifold foldable phone was spotted in the hands of Richard Yu, the former CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, leading to speculation that the Chinese firm may bring the world's first triple-folding phone to market first. Phone makers are racing to create the slimmest foldable phone, with Honor, a former subsidiary of Huawei, taking the lead with the Magic V3 -- literally by just a hair or two over Xiaomi's Mix Fold 4. The benefits of an ultra-slim book-style phones mean a phone with two displays is essentially just as portable as a traditional candy bar smartphone. It's not too difficult to discern the benefits slim hardware could have on multi-hinge phones like the Ultimate 2 -- whether it makes it to market or not.

        "新闻内容": "The weather lately has been crazy. When it's time to use the AC, you want to make sure as much of your air is staying indoors as possible to prevent racking up the energy bill. Especially if you're at risk of being in a blackout, as some areas have experienced a significant recurring risk lately.Whether you're trying to save money on your utility bill or control your house's temperature, you can insulate and air seal your home with these three tips. You'll need to air seal the home's \"envelope,\" seal the ductwork and add attic insulation.These are the most common air leakage issues in American homes that can make a big difference with little investment. Here's how to get started on all three.Air-sealing the 'envelope'First, you'll want to start with air sealing the home. Doing this will get you the most improvement with the least money spent. It's also crucial that you air seal your home before doing any insulation. You're wasting your time, otherwise. Fibrous insulation needs an air barrier to work as it was intended, which is why it's recommended last. When talking about air sealing the \"envelope\" of a home, it's important to note the way air behaves naturally in a building. The pattern of air in and out of your home is known as the \"stack effect,\" and it explains why the temperature in your house often feels like it's different on each floor. Heat rises and cold air moves to lower levels -- so warm air leaves your home through the attic and cold air comes in through a crawl space, unfinished basement or other unconditioned lower part of your house.That's why air sealing the higher and lower levels of your home, in combination with insulation, is one of the best ways to fight air leakage.When a window is drafty, it's obvious to a homeowner immediately. Leaks in attics or crawl spaces are typically worse for the balance of your home's temperature, but they're typically harder to detect. And these areas are going to be the most beneficial in working against the \"stack effect.\" You'll want to air seal window trims, doors, vents, fireplace and furnace flues, and other fixtures like pipes and wires that penetrate the \"envelope\" of the home.Windows will often have gaps around the trim and under the sill. To seal these, you can use a caulk gun. Cut the top of the tube of caulk at a 45-degree angle. Use the pin underneath the gun to break the seal and place the tube into the caulk gun. Position the caulk gun and press the trigger as you go along the frame. The 45-degree angle allows the tip to shape the bead of caulk into a neat line as it's applied, but it still might need some touching up. You can do this easily with your finger. Don't worry about getting it on your skin, as caulk rinses off easily with water.        dlewis33/E+/Getty ImagesYou can also use the caulk gun for areas like a bathroom exhaust fan, floor supply vents and any other crevices. But as far as sealing a flue, you want to make sure to use a fire rated caulk instead for areas that are more combustible to ensure fire safety. And before you air seal a flue, make sure the furnace is off and there isn't a fire going/you've let it cool off enough.  To air seal the front or back door frame, you can add a weather strip. These doors can have a little gap between the door and the outside that's letting not only light to shine through, but allowing air to come in. You can pick up a weather strip kit that comes with everything you'll need.  First, you'll need to remove any old existing weather strip from your door frame. Then you can install the new weather strip. It's easier to start with the left and right side of the frame first and then pressure fit the top. You'll need to measure the side of your door frame and cut the weather strip to fit. And when you cut it, make sure to cut it from the metal side -- you'll get a cleaner cut. Close the door and make sure it's locked before you install the weather strip. If it's not locked and you install the weather strip too close, you could put a lot of tension on the lock and it could break or come out of the wood. Line up the weather strip tightly on the side of the frame, but don't press too hard against the door. Using a drill, put the first screw in the middle, then do the top and bottom next. Now do the same steps for the other side -- and again for the top. \n    More from CNET Home\n   You Can Actually Save Money By Using Electricity at These Specific TimesHow Much Can You Save by Turning the Lights Off Around Your House?Set Your Thermostat to This Specific Temperature in the Summer to Save MoneyFor awkward areas where there's a bigger gap or wires in the way, you can air seal these areas with can foam. It's much easier to just spray the foam in these openings and let it expand.  To use the can foam, attach the nozzle to the top and handle with care. This will not come out of your clothes or carpet, which means you don't want to be making any silly mistakes. Again, leaks in your attic or crawlspace are the most important areas to address. So you can spray the can foam on the openings around pipes and vents and the crevices in a crawlspace and on the tops of the interior walls in the attic. If you have an unfinished basement instead of a crawl space, you can use caulk or can foam to air seal the rim joist and sill plates. Sealing the ductwork If your ducts are leaky and in a space without air conditioning (like a crawl space, unfinished basement, cellar, attic and so on) you'll literally be heating or cooling the outdoors, spending a bunch of money for nothing and losing out on that refreshing air for your own home. When you seal it, more of the heat or air conditioning that was supposed to be pumped into your home will stay inside.  Not only that but sealing your ducts will also improve your indoor air quality. If the duct is leaky, it could be pulling in dirt, dust, mold and possibly radon from outside. Sealing the ductwork allows the duct to only suck from air that's already in the house.  To seal the ductwork in a lower space without air conditioning, you can use a mastic sealant. Mastic is good for sealing the joints of the ductwork because it's fluid and can get into hard-to-reach areas. It's also flexible in that it will withstand expansion and contraction due to temperature changes. The next part is easy. With a rubber glove, you can literally dip your hand in the bucket of mastic and spread it along the seams, joints and holes of the metal ductwork. Just be careful not to get cut, as metal ductwork can have sharp edges.        Miss Pearl/Moment/Getty ImagesAdding attic insulation Last but not least, you'll want to insulate your attic space. As previously mentioned, if you insulate your attic before air sealing the attic floor, it's not going to do much for you.  When talking about insulating the attic space, it's important to note that the insulation and air barrier should be continuous and contiguous (meaning they touch). The continuous part is that it's more effective to have 6 inches of insulation everywhere rather than 10 inches of insulation in a concentrated spot. The contiguous part is wherever drywall is, insulation should be touching it. If it's not touching (for example, if the insulation is on top of wires and not underneath them), the insulation will do nothing.  Another thing to note is that you want to make sure there's no air gap between the layers of \"batts\", which are the strips of insulation.  In other words, you want the insulation to be the same depth as the joists, if you're using batts and not loose-fill (or blown) insulation, because otherwise there will be an air gap when you add the second perpendicular layer of insulation.  If the depth is lower than the joist, there will be an air gap from the second layer; if the depth is higher than the joist, there will still be an air gap from the joist to the second layer. Only the first layer needs to be the same depth, though, the second perpendicular layer can be thicker. And the first layer needs to be as thick as necessary depending on the Energy Star recommended R-value for your geographical location. The R-value is a measurement of how effective a material is in preventing heat loss. The higher the R-value, the better. Keep in mind, when insulating your attic, you want to make sure you're wearing protective equipment and covering any exposed body parts to avoid breathing in dust and fiberglass or getting it on your skin. First, you'll need to clean out the joist bay so the insulation can sit completely flat. Then put a batt of insulation in the bay and cut the length so it fits snugly. Try to cut the batt as perfectly as you can, but it's okay if you mess up -- as long as you fill the bay's depth evenly with insulation.  Then add the second batt layer perpendicular over the joists, so that the wood is also insulated and not just the bay. Energy audits and the Weatherization Assistance Program These tips can help minimize the air leakage and cold spots in your home. But if you do want a more in-depth professional opinion before attempting some of these methods, you can get an energy audit done to your home to see what specific areas your house is lacking in when it comes to energy efficiency.  Also, the US Department of Energy has a Weatherization Assistance Program at the state and local level if you qualify as low income, over the age of 60 or are part of a family with disabilities. You can check with your local utility company for more details.  \n    Here Are 23 Ways to Save On Your Electric Bills Right Now\n            \n        +21 More\n       See all photos  "

Smart plugs are an easy and inexpensive way to make your home more functional. These relatively simple devices can make almost any appliance a little smarter. You’ve probably seen several options for indoor use but if you’re looking for outdoor smart plugs, we’ve put together a list of the best outdoor models available. An outdoor smart plug is a convenient purchase for anyone using wired appliances -- like patio lights, bug zappers, outdoor speakers or electric grills -- in their backyard.A smart plug is essentially a regular power socket, except you’re able to control it from a distance, using an app or digital platform to check what devices are plugged in, whether plugs are still activated, and whether you want to switch them off entirely.Particularly in modern smart homes, it’s a very handy way of keeping track of different devices and making sure you don’t neglect to turn off items that shouldn’t be running overnight. Not to mention the benefits of a smart ecosystem where you can set custom schedules, switch on certain appliances alongside each other, and even use voice commands to activate or control your devices. But these outdoor smart plugs are also designed to be weather resistant and unfazed by rainy days, and there’s a lot to be said for switching an outdoor appliance on or off from the comfort of the indoors.So whether you’re looking to use Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri to command your smart home, we’ll have the outdoor smart plug for you.What to considerThere are few things you'll need to decide when shopping for an outdoor smart plug. Which voice assistant do you use? How many outlets do you want? Some models just have one outlet and some have two. With these questions answered, you'll be on your way to picking the plug that works best for your setup.   \n  Hide our expert take\n     \n      $18 at Amazon\n      \n      $25 at Target\n            Pros \n          Works with Alexa and Google Assistant\n        \n          Two individually controllable outlets\n        \n          Affordable price\n        \n          Great app\n         Cons \n          No HomeKit compatibility\n        \n          No energy monitoring\n          Full Review \n        Read full review\n           $18 at Amazon  \n                Best overall\n               \n                TP-Link Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug\n                  \n      $18 at Amazon\n      \n      $25 at Target\n         TP-Link's Kasa app is easy to use and Kasa devices are quick to set up. The Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug offers two outlets that can be controlled individually, and is rated to operate in temperatures from minus 4 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit. You can choose from voice commands, schedules, timers, scenes or sunrise/sunset modes, as well as an Away feature that randomizes powering outlets on and off. Kasa products work with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, so you'll be able to ask your voice assistant of choice to turn on your lighting. At less than $30, it's a reasonably priced smart plug for your outdoor space. Read our TP-Link Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug review.

The $20 list price is a bit high given that you're only getting a single outlet to control, but it's weatherproof and rated for minus 4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, so if a single outdoor outlet is all that you need, it'll get the job done. In addition to status, timers, scheduling and scenes, the app also provides weather information, a handy addition for any outdoor device. You can also share control with other users if they also download the Braumm app to their mobile device.

It's rated IP64 for protection against water and dust at a temperature range of minus 4 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. You can control the Plug Outdoor with physical buttons, voice control via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, or through the Wyze app. You can also set the plug to run on various automations, such as dusk-to-dawn sensing, vacation mode, custom schedules and triggers based on other devices. Unlike most smart plugs, the Wyze Plug Outdoor includes energy monitoring. You'll be able to receive alerts when energy thresholds are exceeded and view consumption history in the app.              Photo Gallery 1/1           \n  Show our expert take\n     \n  Show our expert take\n     \n      See at Amazon\n            See at Amazon  \n                Best for HomeKit users\n               \n                WeMo Smart Outdoor Plug (Update: Out of stock)\n                  \n      See at Amazon\n         WeMo's Smart Outdoor Plug is a HomeKit compatible option that offers two outlets and voice control for Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant. At about $40, it isn't the cheapest model you can buy, but WeMo's app works well and we've seen several good plugs and outlets from the brand over the years.Rated for temperatures from 32 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, this plug might not be the best bet for cold climates. There are two sockets, but unlike the TP-Link model, they cannot be scheduled or controlled individually. That could be a deal breaker, depending on your use case.

They don't make any changes to your existing outlet. Smart plugs simply disconnect the appliance from power or reconnect it to power when they receive a signal (via app or voice command) to do so.     \n  Show our expert take\n     \n  Show our expert take\n             \n \n                Can I use a regular smart plug outdoors?\n                     This isn't a good idea. Outdoor models are optimized for extreme temperatures and have IP-rated housings that protect them from elements like rain and dust. It's much safer to use a plug made specifically for the outdoors.      \n  Show our expert take\n     \n  Show our expert take\n             \n \n                Do I need Wi-Fi?\n                     Most smart plugs will work in a limited capacity with Zigbee, Z-Wave or Bluetooth connections. However, to get features like voice commands with Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa and to control your plug when you're not close by, you'll need a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection.      \n  Show our expert take\n   "

Your iPhone may charge slower than some Android phones out there, but that may not be its fault. If you've got an iPhone 13 or later, you can get your charging times down with a fast charger. Whether you need to replace that old 5-watt charger at home, get a backup for travel or just need a second charger in a different room of the house, you'll want only the best charger to keep your iPhone's battery in good condition for as long as possible. A modern USB-C charger with multiple ports and plenty of wattage is going to be an ideal pick.Apple has a budget USB-C charger, but there are several alternative options among the best wireless and wired iPhone chargers. We've put together this list of some of our favorite Apple device chargers to give a boost to your battery life. A few quick ground rules before we start:You'll need a charger with a USB-C port, or you'll need to get a USB-A-to-USB-C adapter. At the prices below, you might as well just get a new charger for your Apple product. Chargers with USB-C or PD (power delivery) support can generally charge devices faster than chargers with USB-A ports.Two ports are always better than one, allowing you to charge two phones at once, or a phone and an accessory like wireless headphones.Higher wattage is better up to a point. But getting 18 watts or better will allow you to charge tablets and even a Nintendo Switch. Get 65 watts or more and you can charge most newer laptops, too.Many of these new chargers use a new, fast semiconductor material called gallium nitride, aka GaN, that's replacing the old, slow, silicon chip. Chargers with \"GaNFast\" have a charging speed up to three times faster than traditional chargers -- and they're half the size and weight. They're compatible with everything in today's Apple range, from AirPods and iPhones all the way to the big 16-inch MacBook Pro. They might not be optimal for models older than the iPhone 12, though.Every charger here can also juice up an Android phone (so long as you supply a compatible charging cord or USB cable) as well as a Nintendo Switch.You'll find a ton of different brands, known and unknown, selling chargers, including some generic ones on Amazon that offer 20-watt USB-C chargers for as low as $9 for a three-pack. However, we can broadly recommend three phone charger brands: Anker, Aukey, and RAVPower. All three have similar offerings at similar wattage, and prices fluctuate almost daily. Our latest Apple iPhone favorites are below, including some power bank (battery), wireless, charging stand, and car options. We've used all these over the past few months (or their direct predecessors).Note that none of these incorporate support for the new Apple MagSafe charger technology -- an upgrade from the Lightning connector. That's brand new and will have a price premium for the foreseeable future -- don't expect to pay less than $35.   We've tested most, but not all, of these chargers with iPhones going back to the iPhone 12.Read more: Best iPhone 15 Cases  \n  Hide our expert take\n     \n      $37 at Walmart\n      \n      $24 at Amazon\n            $37 at Walmart  \n                Latest and greatest micro charger\n               \n                Anker Nano II 30W\n                  \n      $37 at Walmart\n      \n      $24 at Amazon\n         The Anker Nano II 30-watt is a next-generation fast charger powered by gallium nitride technology. It's about the same size as the original 20-watt Nano charger but delivers more fast charging power. The Nano II will not only charge your phone but a MacBook Air, iPad and other Apple devices. Anker also sells 45- and 65-watt chargers. Read our first take on Anker's Nano II chargers.

Featuring Anker's PowerIQ 3.0 technology, it charges more than 2.5x faster than that 5-watt charger (with a USB-C-to-Lightning cable). It was recently upgraded from 18 to 20 watts.

While the Anker Nano is a bit smaller, it doesn't have a foldable plug like this model. Using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable, it charges close to three times faster than Apple's standard 5-watt USB charger.

It has both a USB-C and USB-A port so you can charge two devices at the same time, but to get 15-watt wireless charging, you're going to be better off charging one device.               Photo Gallery 1/1           \n  Show our expert take\n     \n  Show our expert take\n     \n      $60 at Amazon\n            $60 at Amazon  \n                Compact 100W USB-C charger\n               \n                Baseus 100W 4-Port GaN II Fast Charger\n                  \n      $60 at Amazon\n         Yes, a 100-watt charger is overkill for charging your phone. But if you want a charger that can charge any USB-C laptop, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro (which happens to be my work computer), the Baseus 100W GaN II Fast Charger is the latest and greatest high-wattage fast-charging USB-C charger. As its name implies, it features GaN II technology. It's both significantly smaller than earlier 100-watt chargers and more energy efficient, so it doesn't heat up as much. It adapts to whatever device you're charging, delivering the highest charging speed that the device is capable of.

Its Wally Mini is a dual-port 20-watt PD charger with fast-charging capabilities. You can charge two devices at once, but to get to top charging speed for your iPhone you'll need to connect it using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable (to the USB-C port) without having any other devices connected to the USB-A port.It has retractable prongs, is quite compact and also feels pretty light. If you didn't know it was made out of recycled plastic, you might not guess that it was. But since I did know, I did think, \"Yes, this feels like recycled plastic.\" Not that it feels bad, but it does look and feel a little different.Nimble also includes a bag in the box for your e-waste items. If your old electronics product is on Nimble's list of approved electronics for recycling, you can print out a free shipping label to send in your gear for recycling.

I like this RAVPower charging pad because it's relatively inexpensive and comes with a power adapter that allows you to get the faster 10-watt wireless charging speeds (some top out at 7.5 watts, and a lot of cheap wireless charging pads don't include a power adapter).

It's very similar to the Aukey and often costs within a few bucks of the same price. This is also a GaNFast charger.

Make sure you see the cost of ink as well.  Whether you are looking for a printer to complete your home office setup or you need one for homework duty, CNET has got you covered. A good printer has become a staple of every home office or business, and even just for a household. From school projects to business notes, there are many uses for a printer and finding one that is a good quality and fits your needs without going overboard on the budget can be a challenge with the number of printers out there. I've been testing printers for a while now, with dozens running at the same time. It gets a little noisy, but with each printer I test the field narrows, leading to the best overall. Check out my top picks to find the best printer for your home office.Every printer we've tested below can manage basic printing needs. For example, they can handle mobile printing and wireless printing from a phone or any PC, Mac or Chromebook, which is a must when it comes to office printers. They can also print over a cabled connection and via wireless printer connectivity. (Note that some, but not all, printers support Apple's AirPrint and Google's Cloud Print protocols, which are usually less onerous than the printer vendors' proprietary systems.) What is the best printer overall?For a home office with just one or two people using it, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e is the best overall choice. The print speed was excellent, and all the printed words were crisp and clear. This isn't a photo printer and it shows, but it works well enough for daily imagery tasks. If you're using it to print brochures or Word documents, this is an almost perfect printer for you.Best printers of 2024  \n  Hide our expert take\n     \n      $290 at Walmart\n      \n      $210 at Amazon\n      \n      $210 at Best Buy\n            Pros \n          Super fast printing and scanning, Large paper tray, feed scanner\n         Cons \n          Dimpling in photos, Pretty darn loud\n               $290 at Walmart  \n                Best overall printer\n               \n                HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e\n                  \n      $290 at Walmart\n      \n      $210 at Amazon\n      \n      $210 at Best Buy\n         If you work from home but need all the advantages of an office printer, the OfficeJet Pro is an excellent choice. In terms of sheer printing speed, the HP is ahead of most others in its price range. It printed the 10 pages in just 32 seconds and scanned and printed them in 58 seconds. Very impressive.The last model had some issues with graphics and imagery, but this new upgrade is much better. The graphics in the brochure test were sharp and accurate, and the images, while being a little dotty, still looked great. The text was excellent, with clearly defined edges, even the Comic Sans parts. It's a bit larger than some of the printers I tested, but the deep paper tray and auto-feed for the scanner make the size worthwhile.Of the printers I've tested so far, the OfficeJet Pro is the most versatile. It also comes with three months of free ink, based on a standard usage if you sign up for HP Plus. While HP Plus does give you some extra helpful app choices for free and the ink, the downside is you can only use HP inks while subscribed to it.               Photo Gallery 1/1           \n  Hide our expert take\n     \n  Show our expert take\n     \n      $139 at Amazon\n            Pros \n          Budget-friendly all-in-one\n        \n          Great text\n        \n          Small footprint\n         Cons \n          Some purpling in the color images, The starter ink is tiny\n               $139 at Amazon  \n                An excellent balance of cost and performance\n               \n                Expression Home 4100\n                  \n      $139 at Amazon\n         After testing the Expression I was pleasantly surprised at how well this printer did. Being Epson's budget option it could have been poor, but instead performed excellently at text reproduction and about average on the image quality. The setup was quick and easy and the Wi-Fi connection seems to be solid wherever I put it in my house. Print time was average at 1 minute, 15 seconds, but the text quality more than made up for the speed. All of the text, even the photocopied text was legible and smooth.The only downside is how small the ink cartridges are on this printer. I know ink is where companies make the most money, but replacing these tiny cartridges every few weeks or months will get old quickly.

The Nelko thermal printer is specifically designed to print labels for packages -- although it does also print other labels -- and if you have an Etsy or Shopify store, it can be an invaluable tool.Most of the tests I've designed for this article don't apply to the Nelko, although the print speed per page is shockingly fast, so it isn't comparable to the other printers here. It's also at the top of the pack of the thermal printers I've tested. The app-controlled Bluetooth connection makes it even easier to print shipping labels. Simply purchase them through Etsy on your phone and print them using the app. You can even crop the image to remove the white space. It's so simple I should have bought one years ago.My only gripe with the Nelko is the lack of roller hooks. I like that the printer is small, but there is no room for a roll of thermal stickers, limiting you to single sheets or jury-rigging something to fit.

The bulky square shape isn't something you would want to see in a fashionable home office. Because of the extra paper tray, the Epson can hold a large amount of paper for. This makes it perfect if you and another person use it daily. It prints fast, too -- the fastest in our test, although the scanning is a little slow. The graphics, text and webpage text were all excellent, although the image quality on glossy paper was only good. This is a workhorse designed for high-volume text, not imagery.My only real issue with the Workforce Pro was the size of the ink cartridges. It's great that you have two large paper trays to hold a lot of paper, but if the amount of ink you have doesn't match, then you are going to have a problem.

Photos came out clear and sharp as did the graphics on the website and brochure test. Even the text was very sharp. For an all-in-one printer at this price, it did every job well. It's a good thing it has Amazon Dash replenishment though, as the ink cartridges are woefully undersized for the printer.

There are plenty of options if you are looking to convert a standard printer to use sublimation ink, but if possible, you should buy a dedicated printer like the Brother SP1 for the job.Brother has recently entered the sublimation market with the SP1, and it's a pretty impressive offering. Like all modern printers, it has Wi-Fi printing and, using the Artspira app on your phone or tablet, you can create great layouts for printing just about any design on anything you can heat press. I appreciate how easy it is to use, although I wish the inks were a little bigger. The price is excellent for a sublimation printer too.

In all of my testing, it came out around the middle of the pack in just about every category. While that could be seen as a negative in a printer that costs several hundred dollars, for one that is as cheap as the Pixma, it's encouraging. The Pixma scored better in color reproduction when placed against other, more expensive all-in-one printers when printing on glossy paper. Some printers suffer from dimpling when printing images, but the Pixma didn't and the skin tones were far better on the Canon image than on other brands. My only real negative is the machine's volume. You can tell it was built on a budget, but as far as budget printers go, this one's pretty good.

In all our tests, it did very well, especially the website printing test, where all the graphics were as crisp and clear as the text. The image test was good too, although not as good as that of the more expensive Smart Tank 7301. The colors were vivid, and there was no sign of chromatic abrasion. There was a little grain in the image, but nothing that better paper couldn't fix.My big bugbear with the 5101 is the rear-loading paper tray. It makes the printer deeper than a standard shelf, limiting where you can put it. It also limits the amount of paper it can store to just a few sheets, making it less than ideal for a larger workload. The lack of a scanner feeder on the top also slows you down, forcing you to scan each document a single page at a time.Overall the 5101 is a good choice if you want excellent color re-creation at a reasonable price. Because it's an ink tank system, the ink should last at least a year.               Photo Gallery 1/1           \n  Show our expert take\n   Other printers we've tested \n  Not all the printers we test make it to the top table. Some of them are good but don't quite make the top of our list, some we replaced with a new version, and some are so bad that we omitted them entirely. Here are some of the printers that nearly made it or have been on the best list but replaced by different models. \n      Show more\n      \n  Show our expert take\n     \n      $649 at Amazon\n      \n      $619 at Walmart\n            Pros \n          Compact\n        \n          Can use different inks\n        \n          Fast\n         Cons \n          No Wi-Fi\n        \n          Some flimsy components\n               $649 at Amazon  \n                Make your art come alive\n               \n                Sawgrass SG500 sublimation printer\n                  \n      $649 at Amazon\n      \n      $619 at Walmart\n         The Sawgrass SG500 is purpose-built to print using sublimation ink and paper. It works great too: You can print up a storm of artwork to put on T-shirts for the whole family. This has a larger ink well than the Brother, but the creaky feeling of the plastic and the extra hundreds of dollars it costs means it can't quite land this printer a top slot.

It printed quickly, and its labels were crisp and sharp, with no issues reading barcodes. It fell when trying to connect to the app. I found the app needed a lot of work, and it failed to connect more times than it connected. It's also a hundred dollars more than its peers and not worth that extra money.              Photo Gallery 1/1           \n  Show our expert take\n   Factors to consider when buying a printer \n  Know what you want your printer to doWhat you intend to print will determine which is the best printer for you. If you're mostly working with shopping lists, concert tickets or travel itineraries, having excellent print quality is arguably less important than print speed and price. If you're using your printer for professional materials or photo printing, then color accuracy, printing quality and the inclusion of features like borderless printing will be primary considerations when you're looking for the right printer. If you're planning on using it for scanning documents, be sure to get a printer with a good scanner.BudgetAnother factor to consider is the cost of ink and ensuring you have enough ink to print everything you need. (There's nothing more frustrating than having a printer but no ink in the ink tank.) Inkjet printers use liquid ink to print, whereas laser printers use toner cartridges containing powder. Even if you're getting a great printer deal, just be sure to do some research into how you'll refill the ink, so you can choose the best printer for your overall budget. Some new printers include an ink subscription in their original price tag, so that may be something to consider as well. \n      Show more\n    How we test printers \n  For a long time, CNET's methodology for testing printers didn't change. Our original testing was designed in the days when Wi-Fi printers were rare and faxing was an important consideration when choosing a device. These days, Wi-Fi is standard, app-controlled printers are everywhere, and what and how we print has changed considerably. I designed a new set of printing parameters in 2022 that I hope will mesh with how we use printers nowadays.Print and copy speed: The speed at which things print and copy are important in our daily lives. Printing a quick theater ticket or copying a document needs to be done speedily and accurately. Testing this is easy; I simply used a stopwatch and printed 10 pages of text of varying sizes and typefaces. I used Fillerama to generate random text from Star Wars and Monty Python and changed the font size randomly across the page. I also used different fonts, like Arial and Times New Roman, to see how they'd print. I even added Comic Sans to the mix, because some people still think it's a good idea to use it (for middle managers mostly).Brochure and webpage test: When asked, people told me they use their home printer for printing online tickets from webpages as well as their resumes for job interviews. With that in mind, I used the standard brochure template from Google Docs, which I changed a little -- I made the font size smaller and larger and changed the font too -- to give that modern resume look. I also saved my article about becoming a Star Wars action figure into a PDF -- I needed to keep the ads the same on every test, so the live article wouldn't do. Sometimes we're in too much of a rush to select just the ticket, so printing the entire webpage is easier. This test simulates that.Receipt test: When you work from home, you often have to submit your receipts for travel and incidentals. One of the most common ways to do that, if you aren't lucky enough to have an app, is to tape receipts to a piece of paper and scan them into your computer. That way you can email them wherever they need to go quickly and easily. To re-create that, I taped my receipts from my food shopping to create a scan. I used a mixture of new receipts and ones that had faded in my wallet, then I checked the scan for legibility. Most scanners will enhance the image you're scanning, and that certainly helps with receipts.Picture quality test: As in previous CNET photo tests, I used the PhotoDisc Target file for my image tests. I printed images on the same Canon glossy paper and studied them according to the guidelines associated with this industry standard. I took special note of the skin tones at the bottom to make sure they were replicated correctly and I also checked for chromatic abrasion. Chromatic abrasion is a purple hue that often surrounds images and can make even the best picture look cheap and tacky. I also checked for stippling; an image error that occurs on poorly calibrated inkjet printers.  \n      Show more\n    Printer FAQs \n       Should you buy a printer with an ink subscription?         Ink subscriptions are becoming more common, with several of the printers on this list offering them as part of the original cost. Are they any good? It all depends on how much ink you use. If you're printing more than 100 pages a month, then yes, it likely is a good deal. Less than that and you may find you don't need it.Most ink subscriptions offer you a certain number of months free, so it's worth trying it to see if it can fulfill your needs, but remember to cancel it before you're supposed to start paying if you don't want it.  \n      Show more\n               What are the different types of printer?         The most common printer types are:Laser printer: Uses light, heat and toner to create text and images (best for text-based documents).Inkjet printer: Uses small dots of ink to create an overall shape (best for photos and images).Sublimation printer: Same as an inkjet printer, but the ink sticks to materials like mugs or T-shirts.Thermal printer: Uses heat and thermal paper to produce text and images (best for printing labels).  \n      Show more\n               How much should a printer cost?         Printer prices can vary from $100 for simple budget printers, to $700 or more for complex printers that can seem like magic. Our favorite printers, especially the all-in-one printers that scan and copy as well, tend to sit at the $200 to $300 mark. If you need something only for text, you can get a good one for $150.  \n      Show more\n           "
