Need gift ideas for birthdays, anniversaries and other events? Our gift guide includes a huge range of suggestions for every occasion.              Which Labor Day sales are the best?       There are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you to shop will depend on what you're hoping to buy.        Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind with stores like Lowe's, Home Depot and Overstock being the places to begin your hunt for home and garden products.        Don't rule out more niche retailers like B&H Photo, Dell, HP and GameStop, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.              When do Labor Day sales end?       Labor Day 2024 falls on Monday, Sept. 2, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Most sales are live or will start to go live soon. Though some might last up to that day, a few might extend past that. We'll be monitoring sales so you can nab the most savings this year.              Should I wait for Black Friday sales?       Labor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those types of products.        Black Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \"Prime Early Access Sale\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.               How do I make the most of Labor Day sales?        Before diving into Labor Day sales, the best thing to do is to narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the many different Labor Day sales out there. Here's a quick list to make it easier for you.        Best Labor Day Amazon deals Best Labor Day laptop dealsBest Labor Day Target dealsBest Labor Day TV dealsBest Labor Day Best Buy dealsBest Labor Day tablet dealsThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on all of the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to follow the team on Twitter and sign up for the CNET Deals newsletter.       \n    Impulse Buys Under $25 That Actually Make Great Gifts\n            \n        +18 More\n       See all photos  ",

Need gift ideas for birthdays, anniversaries and other events? Our\\u00a0gift guide\\u00a0includes a huge range of suggestions for every occasion.              Which Labor Day sales are the best?       There are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you to shop will depend on what you're hoping to buy.\\u00a0       Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind with stores like Lowe's, Home Depot and Overstock being the places to begin your hunt for home and garden products.\\u00a0       Don't rule out more niche retailers like B&H Photo, Dell, HP and GameStop, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.              When do Labor Day sales end?       Labor Day 2024 falls on Monday, Sept. 2, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Most sales are live or will start to go live soon. Though some might last up to that day, a few might extend past that. We'll be monitoring sales so you can nab the most savings this year.              Should I wait for Black Friday sales?       Labor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those types of products.\\u00a0       Black Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \\\"Prime Early Access Sale\\\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.\\u00a0              How do I make the most of Labor Day sales?\\u00a0       Before diving into Labor Day sales, the best thing to do is to narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the many different Labor Day sales out there. Here's a quick list to make it easier for you.\\u00a0       Best Labor Day Amazon deals\\u00a0Best Labor Day laptop dealsBest Labor Day Target dealsBest Labor Day TV dealsBest Labor Day Best Buy dealsBest Labor Day tablet dealsThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on all of the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to\\u00a0follow the team on Twitter\\u00a0and sign up for the\\u00a0CNET Deals newsletter.       \\n  \"}]}\n摘要：本文介绍了在25美元以下能够实际作为礼物的冲动购买物品。\n本文主要讨论了区块链技术在网络安全、医疗健康、智能合约、金融服务等多个领域的应用及其潜在优势。首先，介绍了区块链技术的基本概念和原理，然后分析了它在各个领域中的应用案例。\n\n  在网络安全领域，区块链技术能够通过去中心化的特性，提供更安全的数据存储和传输方式，防止数据被篡改或窃取。此外，通过智能合约的自动执行，可以大大提高网络安全管理的效率和准确性。\n\n  在医疗健康领域，区块链技术可以用于保护患者隐私和医疗数据的安全。通过去中心化的存储方式，患者的医疗记录可以被安全地存储在区块链上，并且只有经过授权的医疗机构才能访问。此外，区块链还可以用于药物追溯，确保药品的真实性和安全性。\n\n  在智能合约领域，区块链技术可以实现自动执行合同条款，提高合同执行的透明度和公正性。智能合约还可以与各种物联网设备连接，实现设备的自动控制和监控。\n\n  在金融服务领域，区块链技术可以提高金融交易的效率和安全性，减少交易成本。同时，区块链还可以用于创建去中心化的金融市场，为更多人提供更多元的投资选择。\n\n  综上所述，区块链技术在多个领域具有广泛的应用前景和潜在优势，它不仅可以提高各行业的效率和安全性，还可以为人们提供更多元化的选择和服务。\n\n\n\n以上文本的摘要为：\n\n本文介绍了区块链技术在网络安全、医疗健康、智能合约和金融服务等多个领域的应用和潜在优势。区块链技术能够提供更安全的数据存储和传输方式，防止数据被篡改或窃取，提高网络安全管理的效率和准确性。在医疗健康领域，它可以保护患者隐私和医疗数据的安全。智能合约可以自动执行合同条款并连接物联网设备。在金融服务领域，它可以提高金融交易的效率和安全性，创建去中心化的金融市场。总之，区块链技术具有广泛的应用前景和潜在优势。\n该文本摘要为：+18 More。\n摘要：查看所有照片。\n"

Strands just moved out of beta, so it's now in the New York Times' official Games app, which might bring it more fans.

If you've found a theme word, it'll light up in blue and stay that way.2. Other words you find are considered hint words that give you clues to the theme words. Find three hint words (they must have at least four letters each), and the game will reward you by showing you a theme word.
